# Hippocratic AI Coding Assignment
Welcome to the [Hippocratic AI](https://www.hippocraticai.com) coding assignment

## Instructions
The attached code is a simple python script skeleton. Your goal is to take any simple bedtime story request and use prompting to tell a story appropriate for ages 5 to 10.
- Incorporate a LLM judge to improve the quality of the story
- Provide a block diagram of the system you create that illustrates the flow of the prompts and the interaction between judge, storyteller, user, and any other components you add
- Do not change the openAI model that is being used. 
- Please use your own openAI key, but do not include it in your final submission.
- Otherwise, you may change any code you like or add any files

## Rules
- This assignment is open-ended
- You may use any resources you like with the following restrictions
   - They must be resources that would be available to you if you worked here (so no other humans, no closed AIs, no unlicensed code, etc.)
   - Allowed resources include but not limited to Stack overflow, random blogs, chatGPT et al
   - You have to be able to explain how the code works, even if chatGPT wrote it
- DO NOT PUSH THE API KEY TO GITHUB. OpenAI will automatically delete it

## What does "tell a story" mean?
It should be appropriate for ages 5-10. Other than that it's up to you. Here are some ideas to help get the brain-juices flowing!
- Use story arcs to tell better stories
- Allow the user to provide feedback or request changes
- Categorize the request and use a tailored generation strategy for each category

---

## How will I be evaluated
Good question. We want to know the following:
- The efficacy of the system you design to create a good story
- Are you comfortable using and writing a python script
- What kinds of prompting strategies and agent design strategies do you use
- Are the stories your tool creates good?
- Can you understand and deconstruct a problem
- Can you operate in an open-ended environment
- Can you surprise us

---

## Other FAQs
- How long should I spend on this? 
No more than 2-3 hours
- Can I change what the input is? 
Sure
- How long should the story be?
You decide

---

## Setup
- Install deps: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Add `.env` with `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key` (key is not stored or committed)

## Usage
- CLI: `python main.py` then enter a story request.
- UI: `streamlit run streamlit_app.py` to launch the Streamlit app. You can paste the API key in the sidebar if not set in the environment.

## Architecture
The flow uses an outliner, writer, judge, and refiner loop plus an illustration prompt hook.
